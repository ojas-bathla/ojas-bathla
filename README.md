<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Ojas </h1>
  
I'm a Bioinformatics enthusiast and aspiring Data Analyst currently pursuing my PG Diploma in Bioinformatics from St. Xavierâ€™s College, Mumbai. 
I hold a BSc (Hons) in Biotechnology from Manipal University Jaipur, and I'm passionate about integrating data science with molecular biology to make sense of complex biological systems.
I enjoy working on interdisciplinary projects that involve analyzing large-scale biological or business datasets.
From studying epigenetic regulation in cancer to visualizing hotel booking patterns using SQL and Power BI, I love combining my life science knowledge with data-driven approaches.
Currently exploring the intersection of Data Science, Molecular Biology, and AI.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Building interactive dashboards and SQL-based data insights  
- Analyzing datasets (YouTube trends, Diwali sales, hotel bookings) using Python, SQL & Power BI  
- Internship projects using Power BI and SQL for data-driven insights

ðŸŒŸProjects & Highlights

- Co-authored a paper exploring the overexpression of EZH2 in breast cancer through analysis of miRNA, lncRNA, and hypomethylation patterns.  
- Designed a project to predict the 3D structure of Bordetella pertussis protein.  
- Built end-to-end dashboards analyzing YouTube, hotel, and Diwali sales data using SQL and Power BI.  
- Internal round winner at Smart India Hackathon with a Career Recommendation System built on personality and career interests.
